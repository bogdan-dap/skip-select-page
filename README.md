# skip-select-page

Redesign Approach

 - I kept the main elements of the page as close to the original as possible so the new changes blend with the existing functionality.

 - The color palette now includes shades of olive green, giving it a more eco-friendly vibe, fitting for the activity.

 - Added subtle hover effects on buttons to to enhance visibility.
 
 - A zoom-in effect on hover was applied to the skip options cards for a more dynamic feel abd a better user interaction.

 - When clicking "Select this skip", the button is marked as selected, and a modal pops up. This modal provides a brief recap of the selected optionâ€™s details for better clarity.

 - The "Continue" button inside the modal takes the user to the next step, with a placeholder currently in place.

 - If the user clicks "Close" or outside the modal, it disappears, and the selection mark is removed from the select skip button.
 
 - A slight fade-in and fade-out effect was added to the modal when opening and closing for a smoother and more engaging user experience

 - I also tried to keep the code clean and reusable, and to create a responsive design for a smooth experience across all devices.
